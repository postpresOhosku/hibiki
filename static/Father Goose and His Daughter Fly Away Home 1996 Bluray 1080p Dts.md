## What is Fly Away Home About?
 
Fly Away Home is based on a true story of Bill Lishman, a Canadian inventor and sculptor who taught geese how to fly with his ultralight aircraft. The film adapts this story into a fictional tale of a father-daughter relationship that is healed by their shared passion for wildlife conservation.
 
The film begins with Amy (Anna Paquin), a 13-year-old girl who loses her mother in a car crash in New Zealand. She is sent to live with her father, Thomas (Jeff Daniels), a free-spirited artist and inventor who lives on a farm in Ontario. Amy feels alienated and lonely in her new environment, until she finds a nest of abandoned goose eggs in the woods. She decides to hatch them and raise them as her own, with the help of her father and his friends.
 
However, when the geese grow up, they face a problem: they don't know how to migrate. Amy and Thomas learn that the geese will be killed by wildlife officials if they don't leave the farm. They also learn that geese imprint on the first thing they see when they hatch, which means that Amy is their mother. Therefore, they come up with a plan: to teach the geese how to fly and lead them to a wildlife sanctuary in North Carolina, using Thomas' homemade ultralight aircraft.
 
The film follows their adventurous journey across the continent, as they face various obstacles and dangers, such as bad weather, hunters, and authorities. Along the way, they also bond with each other and with the geese, forming a unique family that transcends species boundaries.
